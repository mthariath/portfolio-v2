# Mike Thariath Portfolio Website

A portfolio website built using Gatsby V2, a React based static site generator.

For an overview of general Gatsby functionality, see the [Gatsby V2 documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/).

## Test Run

Clone the repo and navigate into your shiny new directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/mthariath/portfolio-v2
cd portfolio
```

Install all the modules:

```sh
yarn install
```

or

```sh
npm install
```

Make sure that you have the Gatsby CLI program installed:

```sh
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

And run from your CLI:

```sh
gatsby develop
```

You can now access the project from the browser (localhost:8000 by default.)
